# Watches

Watches Beta has an options page and a packaged CLI over the same background
handlers. Read `docs/watch-live-verification.md` for the current observed matrix
and account constraints, and `docs/watch-boundary-coverage.md` for the tests that
own simulated failures and interruptions.

## Built page and CLI

1. Launch the dedicated profile with the existing login, source `session.env`,
   and run doctor. Package tools with `vp run package:tools` before using the
   smoke script. It invokes `artifacts/gramgrab.mjs`, not a source CLI wrapper.
2. Run `node .agents/skills/verify-gramgrab/scripts/watch-smoke.mjs --check
   .local/verify-evidence/run/watch-smoke.json`. The script checks the existing
   official `instagram` Watch, list/needs/inbox count parity, per-kind stderr
   progress, one terminal stdout result, failure exit status, inapplicable
   recovery and unknown-entry refusals. Omit `--check` for read-only page/CLI
   checks. A missing existing Watch fails the requested check.
3. On `chrome-extension://$GRAMGRAB_EXT_ID/options.html`, open Add Watch. Preview
   an existing visible target, verify the disclosure, and verify that Stories
   is disabled with `IG_RESPONSE_SHAPE_UNKNOWN`. Posts, Instants and Avatar
   remain selectable. Creation stays disabled until acknowledgement. An existing
   target opens its Watch instead of creating a duplicate.
4. Use naturally collected entries for `watch inbox export` in Direct, Frame
   and Silent modes, then `watch inbox retry ENTRY_ID PLAN_ID` for failed frozen
   plans. Compare requested/delivered History, preserved accepted siblings and
   page recovery controls. Use `watch needs` attention IDs for retry, dismiss or
   confirm only where that operation is offered. Check problems are not action
   recovery targets. Removal affects inbox metadata only.

Watch checks pace requests and can take minutes. Rerunning inside five minutes
may defer a check; keep that terminal result as evidence. All-digit WATCH values
mean account IDs unless `--username` forces a username. CLI help is the grammar
reference, including explicit Silent re-encode approval.

## Evidence

The smoke script holds CLI responses and identifiers in memory and writes only
booleans and closed failure codes. Keep every other Watch evidence file to the
same contract. Store screenshots in `.local/pr-media/`, and redact the verified login and any
private preview target before attaching them to a
PR. A public official target may appear in PR screenshots, but raw CLI responses,
store dumps, identifiers, captions, session data and signed media URLs do not
belong in the local result files or attachments.

Follow the live procedure for restart, alarm recreation and two-minute catch-up.
Record unrun media, Avatar-change, rename, Instant, Save As and Firefox rows as
accepted gaps. A row that did not run does not disable its kind. Watches remains
Beta in normal releases until Arnab explicitly removes that label.
